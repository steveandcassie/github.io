  <h1>Violet and Vey: The Brockman cats</h1>
    <img src="images/VioletandVey.jpg" alt="Young Vey in the tall grass">
    <p>This is a photo of when Violet and Vey were younger.  Little Vey reacted to Violet like she was her mom!</p>
    <p>When Cassie, Amanda and Jesse decided they wanted cats, I said"As long as I don't have to clean the cat litter, it's ok with me".  I clean the litter twice a day!!</p>
    <p>Here are Violet and Vey's favorite things to do:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>Eat treats!</li>
           <li>Play with each other</li>
           <li>Snuggle</li>
           <li>Give Cassie lots of love!!</li>
      </ol>
